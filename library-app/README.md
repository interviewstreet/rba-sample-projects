## Problem Statement

Create a REST API to manage books and libraries.

**Models**

- The `book` has the following attributes:
    - `isbn`: The unique string identifier.
    - `name`: The name of the book.
    - `author_name`: The author name.
    - `publication_year`: The year of publication.
    - `selling_price`: The selling price.

- The `library` has the following attributes:
    - `id`: The autogenerated sequential unique integer identifier.
    - `name`: The name of the library.

**Routes**

- *Books Controller*
    - `POST '/books'`: Creates a book. The request body is a JSON:
        ```json
        {
          "isbn":,
          "name":,
          "author_name":,
          "publication_year":,
          "selling_price":,
          "library_id":
        }
        ```
        Here, `library_id` is optional. It implies that the book should be added to the specified library if not present.
    - `PUT '/books/{isbn}'`: Updates book attributes. Note that updating the library must remove the book from the existing library.
    - `GET '/books'`: Returns all the books. The response should be JSON array:
        ```json
        [
          {
            "isbn":,
            "name":,
            "author_name":,
            "publication_year":,
            "selling_price":,
            "library_id":
          }
        ]
        ```
    - `GET '/books/{isbn}'`: Returns a book. The response should be JSON:
        ```json
        {
          "isbn":,
          "name":,
          "author_name":,
          "publication_year":,
          "selling_price":,
          "library_id":
        }
        ```
    - `DELETE '/books/{isbn}'`: Deletes a book.

- *Libraries Controller*
    - `POST '/libraries'`: Creates a library. The request body is a JSON:
        ```json
        {
          "name":
        }
        ```
    - `GET '/libraries'`: Returns all the libraries. The response should be JSON array:
        ```json
        [
          {
            "id":,
            "name":,
            "books":
          }
        ]
        ```
        Here, `books` is JSON array describing all the books present in the library:
        ```json
        [
          {
            "isbn":,
            "name":,
            "author_name":,
            "publication_year":,
            "selling_price":
          }
        ]
        ```
    - `GET '/libraries/{id}'`: Returns a library. The response should be JSON:
        ```json
        {
          "id":,
          "name":,
          "books":
        }
        ```
        Here, `books` is JSON array describing all the books present in the library:
        ```json
        [
          {
            "isbn":,
            "name":,
            "author_name":,
            "publication_year":,
            "selling_price":
          }
        ]
        ```
    - `DELETE '/libraries/{id}'`: Deletes a library. Note that deleting a library must not destroy the books but should update the library attribute for each of the books present in the library.
